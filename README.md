# Restaurant-Website 👨‍🍳💻🏨
This Website is of Restaurant situated in **Pune, Mahrashtra**; developed for the ease-of the restaurant for taking orders and for, customers knowing their Menu being served. Just for the case of practising Web-Develeopment and the skills of how to develop a website from scratch.

The development of this website was started after I completed learning the techstack of Web-development (i.e. HTML, CSS and JavaScript). This course was offered by The Johns Hopkins University on Coursera entitled as HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers by Yaakov Chaikin - Adjunct Professor, Graduate Computer Science at Whiting School of Engineering.

This website is solely developed by me (Utkarsh Tambe) only by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the help of Ajax-calls.
